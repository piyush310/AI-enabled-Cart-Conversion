I have bought so many different brands of laptops over the years and Dell is clearly the best brand. Every laptop I have bought from Dell has met my expectations. Dell makes good quality laptops. I just bought the Inspiron 15 5000 laptop and it's AMAZING! It's FAST and I LOVE it! The keyboard lights up too. Thank you Dell! I will never buy any other brand of computer except Dell.
I just had my brand new Dell XPS 15 go into a loop while trying to reset my laptop. I called in and asked for some help. The lady that helped me was MarieKate, and she did an amazing job. Walked me step by step for an hour, to find out how to fix it. She was amazing and I hope that the rest of the Customer Support is just like her. She tried multiple things to help get my laptop back up and running. She needs to be recognized!!!
I called Dell Concierge Support on Friday regarding my Dell Inspiron's damage to its right corner due to a fall from my sofa. They were exceedingly helpful, courteous and knowledgeable. I received a FedEx label and Dell box to ship my laptop for repair on Monday morning. I wrapped it carefully with the bubble wrap they provided and sent it to Dell for repair on Monday afternoon at about 4:00 PM. I was so pleasantly surprised at receiving my laptop back this morning via FedEx overnight service. My laptop looks and feels brand new! THANK YOU DELL Customer Service!!!
